# # # Basics of python
# # # Type casting - example: converting a data type from integer type to String type
# # # String Handling
# # # Multiple assignments to a variable
# # # FMPL - Functions, Modules(Collection of functions, invoked by dot), Package(Collection of modules), Libraries(Collection of Packages)
# # # Functions - Inbuilt functions & User defined functions
# # # Inbuilt Functions - print, input, with string modules 
# # # Importing the math modules


# # # Variables
# import this


# name = "Abinaya"
# print ("hi " + name )
# name = "John"
# print ("hi " + name)
# name = "John"        # string  - Dynamically typed language (((No need mention the data type, like int price = "45" ))) 
# price = 45           # integer  - Variable name Starts with ( letter or _) Dont use capital letters in python
# Amount = 35.5        # float
# child = True         # Boolean 
# print (child)

# # # # inbuilt methods in strings - methods are Similar to functions
# print (name.upper())    # print() is a function & upper() is a method. Both will come with paranthesis    # method wil be called/invoked by .(dot)

Write the function solution which takes an integer as input and returns the sum of all the digits.

Examples:

2 -> 2
123 -> 6 (1 + 2 + 3)
1357 -> 16 (1 + 3 + 5 + 7)
